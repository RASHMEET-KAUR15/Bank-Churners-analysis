# Bank-Churners-analysis
This repository contains the SQL file  of bank churners

OBJECTIVE:-The main objective of this project is to analyze the data and predict who is going to get churned so that we can proactively go to the customer to provide them better services and turn customer's decisions in the opposite direction.

* To publish the findings based on data analysis.

*For analyzing the data,various factors affecting the business(i,e) should be listed out.

*In this case study,there are 21 factors mentioning the age,salary,marital status,credit card limit,credit card category etc of 10,000 customers.

#IMPORTANT FACTORS FORMING A GENERAL TREND AMONGST THE ATTRITED CUSTOMERS ARE AS FOLLOWS:-
--> Customer's age
--> Income category
--> Gender
--> Tenure of relationship with bank
---> Marital status
--> Education level
--> Average utilisation

Key Takeways:-

1)The number of customers attriting in the age range of '40-50' years is highest followed by 50-60 years.

2)The difference in the average age of male and female amongst the existing and attriting customers has almost no difference at all and all hovers around the 46 years mark.

3)The number of 'FEMALES" are higher amongst both the attrited and existing customers.

4)The possibility of a 'FEMALE' customer attriting is higher than that of a 'MALE' customer.

5)Those customers who are 'DOCTORATE' and 'POST_GRADUATES' have a very high attrition rate as compared to existing customers.

6)The number of customers who had left the bank is the highest for the customers whose marital status is 'MARRIED'.

7)The attrition rate for customers is the highest for those who have been with the bank for '30-40' months followed by 40-50 months.
So,we should concentrate on the range of 20-30 months customers with the bank.

8)We can summarize that lesser the utilisation on the customer's card the higher the chance of attrition.
